Our club collects pop tabs year round for the Special Olympics. This year
we also received a cash donation for the Special Olympics which was sent
on to their headquarters. The Alternative high school in the college has
also been saving tabs for our collection, which has helped out a great
deal. We assist the Special Olympics in our own way as they seek excellence.</DD>

When the blood drive was held at the college, blood was donated by some
of our members such as Mike and our advisor Lecia. We give of ourselves
even though we don't know who the recipient might be. Members of our club
also took part in signing up other participants.</DD>

We made a donation of two movie tickets to the Alumni Membership drive
at the our college.</DD>

We sponsored a winter clothing drive during November and December . We
placed fliers all over the college along with boxes to collect the winter
clothing. The response was great, we received everything from jackets and
coats to sweaters and pants. The final total was two large boxes and eight
to ten large plastic bags of clothing.</DD>

In December we decided to adopt a family for Christmas. We gain by helping
others in need. After receiving the information sheet on the family a shopping
trip was in order. We allocated $100 toward this project. With the information
sheet in hand Stephanie and Beth went shopping. The information contained
ideas and sizes for each member of the family which made the hunting easier.
Along with purchasing gifts for Christmas the club decided to also pick
up food for a special Christmas dinner.</DD>

We have sought to improve the world around us; sometimes through sacrifice,
sometimes not. We have gained a measure of excellence as we follow this
path and have grown from the experience.</DD>
