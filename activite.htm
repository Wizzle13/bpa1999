The Student Senate sponsored a pumpkin carving contest in which any organization
or club in the college could participate. As Business Professionals we
decided this would be a good way to raise a little money and have fun doing
it. Beth, Stephanie, Kim, Chris Holl, and Gena put forth the effect and
carved themselves a great pumpkin . We found it to be a great diversion
from the pressures of schoolwork and a chance to grow by expressing our
creativity. Our pumpkin won third place and we received $25 for our effort.</DD>

The Aviation club along with the Red Cross sponsored a blood drive at our
school. We felt that it was a way to give directly of ourselves and help
people that we didn't know. We improve ourselves by helping others. Mike,
Kim, Stephanie, and Lecia our advisor assisted in the drive by giving blood
and helping to sign up other participants.</DD>

The Fall Leadership Conference was held in Des Moines, Iowa on October
21 and 22. Kim, Beth, Gena, Jay, and Mike participated in the conference.

Our club sponsored a winter clothing drive. We put up fliers and set out
boxes throughout the college. The response was tremendous: we collected
boxes and bags of winter clothing to donate to the needy. The final total
was two large boxes and eight to ten large plastic bags of clothing. We
help ourselves to grow by improving the lives of others.</DD>

Once again the Student Senate sponsored a hall decoration contest. Another
fun time was about to begin. Our creativity came out and we were able to
cheer people up and get them into the spirit of Christmas. Jolene came
up with our theme, Count down to Christmas, and Beth and Gena decorated
a tree with cut out numbers and strips of calculator tape as garland. Chris
Burton use his computer to make the banner stating our theme. We received
many comments about our decoration, but did not win an award from the Student
Senate. The great complements from the passersby were fantastic and made
the effort well worth it.</DD>

Our club decided to sponsor a needy family for Christmas. We gain by helping
others in need. The staff at Upper Des Moines Opportunity chose a family
for us, and Stephanie and Beth went on a shopping trip. We allocated $100
toward the project. The information sheet we received gave us super ideas
and the sizes for each member of the family. Our club also decided to purchase
food for a wonderful Christmas dinner for the family.</DD>

<DD>
Our club held our Christmas party at the school for everyone to participate.
Treats were brought by all, and enjoyed by all . We sat around telling
stories and laughing . It was a good party.</DD>

Time for raising more money. The college held a Jazz Band competition which
usually brings 1,000 extra people into the college. We decided to hold
a bake sale. We would feed their bodies while the competition would challenge
their minds and spirits. Everyone picked an item to bake and we purchased
homemade rolls from the bakery. Our response to the bake sale was great;
those high school kids could sure eat. We raised $100 after expenses.</DD>

We have sought to improve the world around us; sometimes through sacrifice,
sometimes not. We have gained a measure of excellence as we follow this
path and have grown from the experience.</DD>
