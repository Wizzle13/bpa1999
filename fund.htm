Our first attempt at fund-raising was to sell raffle tickets. The raffle
was for one of two $25 gift certificates to a business of the winners'
choice. This idea was great, it didn't restrict anyone from purchasing
a ticket. Our response was good and we had a good start increasing our
fund.</DD>

Our second fund-raiser was a bake sale which received a super response.
It was held on the day the college sponsored a Jazz Band competition. We
would feed their bodies while the competition would challenge their minds
and spirits. We set up our table in the main hallway and with the smell
of the freshly baked rolls and goodies it was hard for anyone to resist.
The response was overwhelming. In fact, one of the club members went home
and made more bars. We raised $100 after expenses.</DD>
